# SportsGearTracking
This is a simple sports equipment tracking project. I needed such an application to track the mileage of my running shoes, the mileage of my bike between mechanical overhauls.
This project is mainly for me to learn Falsk, SQLALchemy, BootStrap, ... and why not one day to synchronize my Polar Flow account and retrieve my rides.

For the moment, the application will allow to enter sports, workouts, gear and to link one of these gear to workouts.
